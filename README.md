Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am Amanda Emily Smith. I am studying junior web development in Generation, an amazing bootcamp to accelerate my skills. I have learned the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, SCRUM and Bootstrap. We will soon dive in Javascript! I am so excited about this work. 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a task management application.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning responsive design.
